CedarKart-Bloons
================

This is a buggy cart-racing game developed off of JMonkeyEngine for a computer graphics class.

I specialized in the area of networked play for this project. Carts will broadcast position
updates regularly, and in between updates each client tries to guess where other players'
carts will move. This effectively eliminates jitter on all but the sharpest moves.
